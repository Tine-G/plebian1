## About
This repository contains various code examples for the Arduino Platform and modules that can interface with Arduino development boards. In the `code` section, you will find the code examples and implementations, while detailed explanations of the code and libraries used are detailed in the [wiki](https://github.com/Tine-G/plebian1/wiki) secion of this repository.

## License
**All code in this repository is intended to be completely free to use. As with other permissive licenses, any form of warranty is not given.** However, I would very much appreciate it if you, the user do not copy all the code just to create your own repository with it. The reason for this is that as the code in this repository is improved, new repositories might be created to house the resultant fully functional libraries, at which point, having multiple repositories with the same code might be confusing for users and defeat the purpose of an open source project.

## Disclaimer
This repository is used mainly for persoonal purposes. However, if there are any mistakes to be corrected or improvements to be made please let me know. The code in this repository should NOT be considered as a fully functional library. If these lines of code are optimized enough in the future, maybe a new repository will be created to house the full fledged libraries, in which case the repositories will be linked here.
